# ads-CTR-optimization-using-reinforcement-learning
**Project Description:** Optimize ad selections using Reinforcement Learning. This project compares the effectiveness of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms, analyzing Click-Through Rate (CTR) for improved ad engagement. Visualize results through histograms and contribute to advancing advertising strategies.


**Overview:**
This project implements two reinforcement learning algorithms, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, for optimizing ad selection. The Click-Through Rate (CTR) of ads is analyzed to maximize user engagement and improve advertising strategies. The project provides a comparative study of these algorithms through visualizations and histograms.

**Key Algorithms:**
1. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):**
   - Utilizes UCB to balance exploration and exploitation.
   - Calculates upper bounds for ad selections, optimizing for higher expected rewards.

2. **Thompson Sampling:**
   - Implements Thompson Sampling, a Bayesian approach to decision-making.
   - Models uncertainty in ad selections through random sampling from beta distributions.

**Metrics and Visualization:**
- **Histograms:** Visualizes the frequency of ad selections for both UCB and Thompson Sampling.
- **CTR Analysis:** Evaluates the Click-Through Rate to measure the effectiveness of ad strategies.

**Relevance of CTR:**
Click-Through Rate (CTR) signifies the percentage of users who click on a specific ad compared to the total users who view it. A higher CTR indicates more effective ad engagement and potentially better revenue generation.

**Usage:**
1. Run UCB algorithm to optimize ad selections.
2. Visualize the impact of UCB through histograms.
3. Implement Thompson Sampling and compare results.
4. Analyze CTR to assess the performance of ad strategies.
